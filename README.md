# Genomic-Variant-Calling-and-Annotation
This repository contains scripts and tools for performing genomic variant calling, annotation, and analysis for obesity-related genetic studies. The workflow involves quality control, trimming, alignment, variant calling, and annotation of variants based on multiple databases such as RefSeq, Ensembl, ClinVar, and dbSNP.
